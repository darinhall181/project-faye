"""
Authentication utilities for Faye.

Overview
--------
- Credentials are read at runtime from Streamlit secrets (st.secrets)
  which are stored locally in .streamlit/secrets.toml (git-ignored) or
  configured in the hosting environment (e.g., Streamlit Cloud Secrets UI).
- Upon successful login, pages set st.session_state["authenticated"] = True
  and st.session_state["username"] to the logged-in user. These values
  live for the duration of the userâ€™s session in the browser.
- Pages should call ensure_authentication() at the top to redirect
  unauthenticated users back to the login page.
